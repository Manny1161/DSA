Introduction to fundamental data structures, algorithms and techniques in computing. Basic structures include stacks, queues and linked lists. Advanced structures explored are trees, hash tables and heaps. Algorithms discussed include sorting and recursion. Complexity analysis of these areas is also examined.

Practical Assessments

Weekly asessed assignments to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't provide the worksheets that these are based on for copyright reasons so they don't make a lot of sense without context.
